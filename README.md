Final project presentation for CPSC 355

## Background ##
This project represents the work done for Chapman's CPSC 355 Human Computer Interaction class.  The purpose of this project was to quickly develop an app while going through a full design procedure.  While the final project may not look polished, the primary reason for the project was to gain experience with some of the industry workflows and tools.  I conducted user testing, AB testing, collecting feedback, and wireframing.
